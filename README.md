# Lingo

Site for language learning where the user can get the word's meaning on click.

This app was created based on [Lingq](https://www.lingq.com). Here the user can upload lessons which are basically just text and their words are marked with 6 levels of acquisition:

- 0: Unknown - blue
- 1: New - orange
- 2: Recognized - orange, 75% opacity
- 3: Familiar - orange, 50% opacity
- 4: Learned - orange, 25% opacity
- 5: Fully Learned - transparent
- Null: Removed by the user - transparent

For now, the app only supports 4 languages: Latin, English, Portuguese and Spanish.
